I decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host some information online.
The system is fairly simple to use:
* create a repository with some markdown
* configure the settings of that repository to have Github render it to HTML using Jekyll.

The initial template is a bit rudimentary, so I decided to try using the ["Minimal Mistakes" template](https://mmistakes.github.io/mm-github-pages-starter/).
