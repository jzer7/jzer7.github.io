I decided to use Github Pages to host some information online.  The system is fairly simple to use, you just create a repository, which holds regular markdown. Then Github renders it to HTML using Jekyll.  The initial template is a bit rudimentary, so I decided to try using the ["Minimal Mistakes" template](https://mmistakes.github.io/mm-github-pages-starter/).
