I decided to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host some information online.
The system is fairly simple to use:
* create a repository with some markdown
* configure the settings of that repository to have GitHub render it to HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

For my first try, I used a basic `README.md` file. Then I picked the [Slate theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/slate/) -- one of the pre-configured themes.
But I found it a bit too limited.
So I decided to use the ["Minimal Mistakes" template](https://mmistakes.github.io/mm-github-pages-starter/).
