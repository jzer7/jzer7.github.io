I've been thinking about putting my environment configuration files (aka _dotfiles_) into an SCM.

Several folks have their dotfiles on Github (e.g., [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles), [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), [jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles)).
There's even an [unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## Challenge

IMO, the main decision is how to bootstrap them.
I see 3 schools of thought:

1. Clone your repo directly to your home directory.
2. Clone your repo to a separate directory. Then symlink your files. For example, see [caarlo0's bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles/blob/master/script/bootstrap), or [jessefraz's Makefile](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile).
3. Like #2, clone repo to a separate directory. But then use some tooling to sync config files and scripts to your home directory. For example, see [mathiasbynens's bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh).

Approach #1 is not elegant or clean, and can lead to confusion.
I'm not going to do that.

Approach #2 has the advantage that you can modify the files directly, test them and commit.
But the disadvantage is it seems messy.
At best, lots of symlinks when you do `ls`.
At worst, some scripts might get confused.

Approach #3 is visually and operationally clean.
But the disadvantage is that you need to modify the files on the directory for your repo.
So there's friction when editing and testing the files.

## Approach

Today, I learned about [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).
It is a _dotfile_ manager that uses Approach #3.
But they provide tooling to simplify the deployment of the configuration files.
It also offers templates which _could be_ helpful.
(NOTE: don't overdo templates or you'll pay the price. Remember Jinja2 templates on Ansible ðŸ˜Ž).

BTW, there are several other [utilities to manage dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/).
