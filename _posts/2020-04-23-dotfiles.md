## Idea

I've been thinking about putting my environment configuration files (aka _dotfiles_) into an SCM.

Several folks have their dotfiles on Github (e.g., [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles), [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)). There's even an [unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## Challenge

IMO, the main decision is how to bootstrap them. I see 3 schools of thought:

1. Clone your repo directly to your home directory.
2. Clone your repo to a separate directory. Then symlink your files. 
3. Like #2, clone repo to a separate directory. But then use some tooling to sync config files and scripts to your home directory.

Approch #1 is not elegant or clean, and can lead to confusion. I'm not going to do that.

Approach #2 has the advantage that you can modify the files directly, test them and commit. But the disadvantage is it seems messy. At best, lots of symlinks when you do `ls`. At worst, some scripts might get confussed.

Approach #3 is visualy and operationally clean. But the disadvantage is that you need to modify the files on the directory for your repo. So there's friction when editing and testing the files.

## Approach

Today, I learned about [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). It is a _dotfile_ manager that uses Approach #3. But they provide tooling to simplify the deployment of the configuration files. It also offers templates which _could be_ helpful. (NOTE: don't overdo templates or you'll pay the price. Remember Jinja2 templates on Ansible ðŸ˜Ž).
