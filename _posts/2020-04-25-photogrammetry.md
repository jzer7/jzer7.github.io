I was watching some videos on photogrammetry ([part 1](https://youtu.be/ye-C-OOFsX8) and [part 2](https://youtu.be/1D0EhSi-vvc)) by [Josef Prusa](https://twitter.com/josefprusa).

It is very similar to the photo-stitching work people used for 2D images, plus the point cloud extraction.
I remember seeing something done by Microsoft Research maybe around 2013, but I cannot find it.
