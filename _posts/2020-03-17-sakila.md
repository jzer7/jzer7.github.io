I learned today about the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).
It has a non-trivial, but understandable schema, which is helpful when practicing SQL commands.

[![Sakila schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/images/sakila-schema.png)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-structure.html)

It is also easy to download and install.
* [ivanceras / sakila](https://github.com/ivanceras/sakila) has instructions for multiple DBMS
* As an [sqlite3 file](https://github.com/bradleygrant/sakila-sqlite3).
* Even as preloaded [containers](https://github.com/sakiladb).

To try out this, we can easily run 2 containers: the first will run the DBMS and the data, and we will log to the other one to access the CLI.
First we create a shared network so they can communicate:

```sh
docker network create --driver bridge mysql-net
```

Then the DBMS pre-loaded with Sakila:
```sh
docker run -p 3306:3306 -d --network mysql-net --name sakiladb sakiladb/mysql:8
```

Now, I couldn't find an official container just with the CLI.
But here's a simple Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN set-x; apt-get update; apt install -y mysql-client; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists
```

And here we launch it:
```sh
docker run --rm -it --network mysql-net jzer7/mysql-client
```

Both containers share the same network (`mysql-net`), so each is visible to the other under the container name.
So the argument for `-h sakiladb` is the host that has the DBMS.
(The passwords are the defaults shown in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/sakiladb/mysql/blob/aff192f972121e724cc57427d283b39a76715d08/Dockerfile#L19-L22).)
```sh
mysql -h sakiladb -u sakila -p
```

Update:
If you prefer a graphical interface, you can replace step 3, and use _PHP My Admin_.
```sh
docker run --name phpmyadmin --network mysql-net -d -e PMA_HOST=sakiladb -p 8080:80 phpmyadmin
```
Then just launch your browser to <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>.

When you are set, you can try your SQL proficiency with some questions from a [Sakila test](https://datamastery.gitlab.io/exercises/sakila-queries.html).
