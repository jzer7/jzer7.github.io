I was talking with Alex about 3D printing. During the conversation, we covered a lot of topics. Here are some interesting projects we covered:

* [Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-mini/): the smaller version of the Prusa MK3.
  * [Prusa Mini - YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ipulB4_Xdm8)
  * [Blog post](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-mini-is-here-smart-and-compact-3d-printer/)
  * We talked about the [extruder](https://www.sublimelayers.com/2017/06/first-week-with-prusa-mm-quad-extrusion.html), which can have a filament sensor
* Prusa offers their own slicer
* [Slic3r](https://slic3r.org/):

There's a lot of 3D modelers available:

* [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/): I've used Sketchup with an STL exporter plugin. But that was years ago.
* [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/fusion-360-for-hobbyists): as a modeling tool. With a free license for hobbyists
  * I went ahead and installed it using Homebrew
* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)
* [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura): modeling software
* [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/): parametric 3D modeler

Markets to share

* [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/): it is still the preferred place to share models. I didn't know that they were owned by [Makerbot](https://www.makerbot.com/).

The conversation then shifted to electronics... ðŸ˜Ž

* [sigrok](https://sigrok.org/): a framework for signal analyzers.
* [saleae](https://www.saleae.com/): the maker of the tiny FPGA signal analyzer
* [Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate): I still think of it as a signal analyzer, but it is more like a multiprotocol translator. It requires the protocol to be consistent for it to function well.

Moving back to 3D printing:

* [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/download/) is a server that can expose the 3D printer to the network. They offer a Raspian-based image for the Raspberry Pi, with all the software in place.
* [Timelapses of 3D prints](https://youtu.be/S2cpHMoK8mw)
* [Materials you can use to print](https://www.prusa3d.com/material-guides/). Even some with wood powders. Though [printing with wood filaments can be complicated](https://youtu.be/IsmrBeD_YMQ).
* It's cool that [Prusa uses their printers to print their printers](https://youtu.be/BjoQw5fGk6Q).

Going now to machine learning: ðŸ¤–

* [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) framework used to stream video feeds
* [NVIDIA Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware). It is a family of boards with GPUs and arm cores. Alex thinks the Nano can handle basic algorithms in a couple of video feeds.
* [Single camera depth perception](https://open.nasa.gov/innovation-space/single-camera-depth-perception/). An example of what people use ML for.
* [Low light image enhancement](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/low-light-image-enhancement-algorithm-based). Another example of ML for image/video processing/understanding.
  * [Seeing Motion in the Dark](https://cchen156.github.io/paper/19ICCV_DRV.pdf). Cool paper from [Chen Chen](https://cchen156.github.io/).
